What happens behind the Scenes (search engines)?

Introduction:
Have you ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes when you enter a website address in your browser? It’s easy to take for granted the seamless experience of accessing websites, but a complex series of interactions occur to bring you the desired web page. In this blog post, we will take a fascinating journey through the various stages involved when you type “https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter. Let’s dive in!

1. DNS Request:
The first step in this journey is the Domain Name System (DNS) request. Your browser sends a request to a DNS resolver, asking for the IP address corresponding to “www.google.com." The resolver then contacts the authoritative DNS server responsible for the “google.com” domain to obtain the IP address associated with the given hostname.

2. TCP/IP:
Once the DNS resolver receives the IP address, it returns it to your browser. Your browser then establishes a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection with the server at the obtained IP address. The TCP protocol ensures reliable communication by breaking the data into packets, sending them over the network, and ensuring their orderly reassembly at the destination.

3. Firewall:
During the TCP handshake, the firewall comes into play. A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between your computer and the internet, protecting your system from unauthorized access. The firewall analyzes the incoming packets, allowing only the legitimate ones to pass through while blocking potential threats.

4. HTTPS/SSL:
As the connection is established, your browser initiates a secure communication channel using HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). HTTPS ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the data exchanged between your browser and the server. It employs SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security), to encrypt the data and authenticate the server, preventing eavesdropping and tampering.

5. Load-Balancer:
Popular websites like Google employ load-balancers to handle the vast number of user requests efficiently. A load-balancer acts as a traffic distributor, evenly distributing incoming requests across multiple servers to optimize performance and prevent overload. It ensures that the load is balanced among the available servers, improving responsiveness and availability.

6. Web Server:
Once the request reaches the appropriate server, the web server processes it. The web server’s primary responsibility is to handle HTTP requests and serve web pages and other resources to the clients. In the case of Google, the web server processes the request for “www.google.com" and retrieves the relevant web page, passing it back to your browser.

7. Application Server:
In addition to serving static content, many websites rely on application servers to generate dynamic content tailored to each user’s request. The application server executes the necessary software code, interacts with databases, and performs other computations to generate the web page dynamically. For instance, the application server at Google might process search queries and provide personalized search results.

8. Database:
Behind the scenes, databases play a vital role in managing and storing the vast amount of data required by dynamic websites. Application servers communicate with databases to retrieve or update information. In Google’s case, the application server might access a massive database to retrieve relevant search results, advertisements, or user preferences.

In conclusion, the journey of a URL is fascinating, with each component playing a vital role in delivering the website we desire. Whether it’s the DNS request, TCP/IP connection, firewall, HTTPS/SSL encryption, load balancer, web server, application server, or database, every step contributes to the seamless browsing experience we enjoy today. Understanding this process can help us appreciate the incredible technological advances that make the internet possible and enable us to access vast amounts of information at our fingertips.
